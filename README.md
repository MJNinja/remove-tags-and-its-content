# Remove tags and the content between them
In PHP you get the strip_tags() function which allows you to remove all or only specific tags from your string, but it doesn't remove the content between the tags. This is where this function comes in handy. It uses dynamic opening and closing tags and searches for them in the supplied string, and them removes the tags and the content between them.
